"Matute Roofing", "Robbi M.", "Franklin Lakes, NJ", "January 24, 2025", "I was very impressed with my first meeting with Peter Dobrowolski. My estimate appointment was for 4:00 pm and he showed up at 4:01 pm. Peter didn't have to explain much because I was familiar with the roofing process since I met with other roofing companies. He helped us with our color selection and answered all questions. His very polite team showed up early and worked throughout the day with what I saw was only a lunch break (I think). They were extremely great at cleaning up at the end of their workdays, even used a metal roller to pick up nails etc. from around the property. What also impressed me was that since we replaced all the skylights they had a worker come inside to make sure they were properly centered when looking up to the sky. Peter made sure we were completely satisfied with the job. I HIGHLY recommend Matute."
"Matute Roofing", "Paul Kimball", "Not specified", "11 months ago", "Jose (Owner) was amazing to deal with. I wish all contractors were like Jose. The roof job was perfect."
"Matute Roofing", "Debra Esposito", "Not specified", "A year ago", "We were upgrading our whole house after 25 years and Jeff of Matute was recommended by three of our neighbors, who had their roof done. During the installation of our roof, they repaired the chimney and a deteriorated vent pipe, both of which we would have never known if Matute hadn't let us know about it. Jeff overlooked the job almost every day, just to stop by and ensure all was going well. Matute also did the siding on our house and it looks beautiful. We get compliments every day on how beautiful the house looks. We would highly recommend Matute."
"Matute Roofing", "Greg Kahn", "Not specified", "A year ago", "Have you ever had a major home project done by a contractor who gave you complete confidence that they were totally trustworthy? It is a great feeling, the kind of feeling we had when Danny, the Matute Roofing representative, gave us an estimate after explaining in detail how the project would be completed. The estimate was significantly lower than others, and we were sold when Danny said he would supervise our roofing job. The Matute Roofing team of 10 men arrived when promised, and they were all experienced professionals who worked efficiently and carefully. The cleanup was thorough, and the roof looks great. I highly recommend Matute Roofing."

Stephen was on top of things and followed through till the project was completed. I would highly recommend him to upgrade your home."
"Matute Roofing", "Melissa D.", "Not specified", "2 years ago", "I would highly recommend Matute Roofing. Our roof was completed yesterday and we could not be happier. Peter D's presentation of the process, including samples of materials, was so much more than we received from any companies we requested quotes. The price, warranty, and professionalism were what made us select Matute. The process was seamless from prep instructions to payment. Any questions were promptly answered by Peter, who also checked in on the days of work. The team working on the roof were super efficient finishing the job in one day."

The work crew arrived on the time agreed. They didn't waste any time getting to the task ahead of them. From start to finish, they did an amazing job. We were impressed with the clean up when they were ending their day. We will highly recommend Preferred Exterior to our friends if they need the services that they provide."
